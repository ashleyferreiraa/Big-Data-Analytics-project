CANADA’S HOUSING MARKET ANALYSIS & PREDICTION

Housing affordability remains a growing concern in Canada, driven by steadily rising home prices that affect the accessibility of homeownership and influence broader economic conditions. While understanding historical trends is essential, the ability to accurately forecast future housing prices is critical for informing policy decisions and guiding market participants. This thesis analyzes the evolution of the New Housing Price Index (NHPI) in Canada from January 1997 to December 2024, focusing on the use of predictive modeling to forecast price movements. The study compares the performance of two predictive models—ARIMAX and Random Forest—using historical NHPI data and key economic indicators: mortgage rates, gross domestic product (GDP), and unemployment rates. In addition to identifying the most accurate predictive model, the research also evaluates which economic factor has the strongest correlation with NHPI changes. By combining model evaluation with economic factor analysis, this study contributes to a better understanding of housing market dynamics and enhances forecasting strategies for Canadian real estate.
This study aims to evaluate which predictive model will be best suited for forecasting the NHPI in Canada and to identify which economic factor most significantly influences housing price changes. I will answer which model—ARIMAX or Random Forest—provides the most accurate prediction of NHPI, and which economic indicator (mortgage rates, GDP, or unemployment rates) is most strongly correlated with changes in NHPI?


To refine my topic, this study will:
-	Analyze economic factors: Investigate historical NHPI data to identify peaks and dips, and assess how mortgage rates, GDP, and unemployment rates influence housing price trends.
-	Compare predictive models: Apply and evaluate ARIMAX and Random Forest models to forecast NHPI and assess their performance using accuracy metrics
